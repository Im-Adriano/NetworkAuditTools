<h1>DNS Enumeration</h1>

The DNS Enumeration script (written in Powershell) is a quick and easy script that
takes in a .txt file with a list of domain names and attempts to resolve the IPs
from that list.

<h1>OS Detection</h1>

The OS Detection script (written in bash) tries to determine remote host OS based 
off of TTL values in ping responses. Takes in a .txt file of IPs to run against, 
with a different IP on each line.
